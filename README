Simple CoreMIDI for Python
==========================

Simple CoreMIDI for Python is the simplest way of using MIDI in Python
on Mac OS X. Period.


Installation
------------

    pip install simplecoremidi


Usage
-----

To send midi out from your application::

    from simplecoremidi import send_midi
    send_midi((0x90, 0x3c, 0x40))

This sends a MIDI Note On signal. To receive it you'll have to
configure your DAW or software to receive from the "simple core midi
source" MIDI source.

To receive midi from another application::

    from simplecoremidi import recv_midi
    data = recv_midi()

This returns all the midi data sent to the "simple core midi
destination" MIDI destination since your last call. Put it inside a
loop and poll it.

Look at the example in the simplecoremidi/examples directory.

To create an Output that will send to a Destination device::

    from simplecoreimid import MIDIOutput
    out = MIDIOutput("Numark ORBIT")
    out.send([0x90, 60, 127])

To create an Input that can read from a Source device::

    from simplecoreimid import MIDIInput
    in = MIDIInput("Numark ORBIT")
    data = in.recv()
    
As before, this returns all the midi data read from the Source since
your last call.  The format of the result is a list of tuples, where
each is one packet.

    [(144, 40, 127), (128, 41, 0), (144, 41, 127)]


Notes
-----

- It only works on Macs. It will never work on Windows or Linux.
- It is not configurable.


HISTORY
-------

- cloned from https://github.com/sixohsix/simplecoremidi
- sheffler added MidiInput, MIDIOutput
- changed format of receive data to list-of-tuples
- added example interfacing with Numark ORBIT controller
